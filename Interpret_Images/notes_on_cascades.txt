need to change label colors so i can read better

jab only works when facing to the right.

neutral_b is working better now
-Add some sheild screenshots to the negative examples
-this needs better training. its not strict enough. recognizes too many things maybe just needs more negatives


sheild works well


TRACKER
i will stick with my current tracker. I just need to find a way to reset it if it looses track of mario. 
Maybe use the tracker in combination with image recognition.
